To push your local project to the GitHub repository at

PS D:\Portfolio> git push -u origin main
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/chanchhanun/Portfolio.git'
This error typically occurs when the branch you are trying to push does not exist locally. By default, Git creates a branch named "master" when you initialize a new repository. If you want to push to the "main" branch, you need to either create it or rename your current branch.
To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:
1. Check your current branch name:
   ```
   git branch
   ```
   If it shows "master", you can either rename it to "main" or push to "master".
2. To rename the branch to "main":
   ```
    git branch -m main
    ```
3. Now, push to the "main" branch:
    ```
     git push -u origin main
     ```

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/chanchhanun/Portfolio.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
This error occurs because the remote repository has changes that are not present in your local repository. To resolve this, you need to pull the changes from the remote repository before pushing your local changes.
To fix this issue, follow these steps:
1. Pull the changes from the remote repository:
   ```
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
   The `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag is used here because the local and remote repositories have unrelated histories.
2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.
3. After successfully pulling the changes, push your local changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
